\title{The \texttt{pimpvanilla} package}
\author{Sylvain Kern}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    This package is intended to slightly improve the look of vanilla \LaTeX{} --upon my standards-- while remaining as light and versatile as possible.
\end{abstract}

\section{What it looks like}

Like this. \lipsum[1-2]

\section{The font}

The font is \texttt{mlmodern}, a little bit thicker version of Latin Modern. The reduced stroke contrast makes it a bit less harsh to look at and more suitable for on-screen reading.

\section{Captions}

Captions change a bit, to make them more distinguishable. See figure \ref{fig:juch}.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=.75\linewidth]{lejuch.png}
    \caption{The famous historical castle of Le Juch, in french Brittany. The family still lives inside at this day. \lipsum[3] \label{fig:juch}}
\end{figure}


\section{Other changes}

Right-justification is slightly improved with the \texttt{microtype} package. Page numbers are now on the right (outside for twoside documents). Margins are reduced so that the text takes more space.
